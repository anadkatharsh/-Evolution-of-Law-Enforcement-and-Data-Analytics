Law Enforcement & Data Analytics
Project Description
This project examines the evolution of data analytics in law enforcement, focusing on how crime data is analyzed to improve public safety. It explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in policing, ethical concerns surrounding AI applications, and the effectiveness of predictive policing techniques.

Key Findings & Results
Historical Evolution: Analyzed how data analytics has transformed law enforcement over time.

Crime Data Analysis: Used location-based and crime category-based approaches to identify crime trends.

AI in Policing: Investigated how AI is used in surveillance, predictive analytics, and automated crime detection.

Ethical Concerns: Highlighted issues such as privacy invasion, AI bias in policing, and misuse of power.

Racial Bias in AI Policing: Discussed how biased training data can lead to discriminatory practices in law enforcement.

Tools & Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Data Visualization: Tableau / Power BI

Machine Learning Techniques: Predictive modeling, clustering, and classification

Data Sources: Law enforcement crime databases, publicly available crime reports
